# Getting started with the lessons
## Setting up the environment -
* Install python version 3.3+, on linux use *apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip*
* Install [pycharm community edition](https://github.com/umangsinghal31/PytestTutorial.git)
* Install in your local or virtual env pytest and its mock libraries, to make it faster use the dependencies.txt file - *pip install -r dependencies.txt*
* Add pytest in pycharm's testing tools - Pycharm -> File -> Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools -> Set **Default test runner** to  pytest

## How to catch up - 
* Start from *test/basics*, go to each case, read the business code and compare it with test.
* Execute each test by a right click on the file and running pytest
